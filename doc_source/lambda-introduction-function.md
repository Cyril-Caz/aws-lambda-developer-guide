# Working with Lambda Functions<a name="lambda-introduction-function"></a>

If you are new to AWS Lambda, you might ask: How does AWS Lambda execute my code? How does AWS Lambda know the amount of memory and CPU requirements needed to run my Lambda code? The following sections provide an overview of how a Lambda function works\. 

In subsequent sections, we cover how the functions you create get invoked, and how to deploy and monitor them\. We also recommend reading the **Function Code** and **Function Configuration** sections at [Best Practices for Working with AWS Lambda Functions](best-practices.md)\.

To begin, we introduce you to the topic that explains the fundamentals of building a Lambda function, [Building Lambda Functions](lambda-app.md)\.
